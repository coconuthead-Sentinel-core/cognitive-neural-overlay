## CSTM alignment

CNO is designed against the CSTM_Lattice v1.0 contract. Current implementation
status:

| CSTM section | Status |
| --- | --- |
| §4 — 10-field metadata frontmatter on emitted artifacts | *planned* |
| §5 — Zone classification on tags emitted | *planned* |
| §6 — Session-state envelope on every dispatch | ✅ implemented (best-guess shape) — every `/cno/process` and `/cno/process/stream` returns `{session_id, envelope_version, spec_ref, run_id, ts, glyph_pipeline, prior_run_ids, payload, spec_gaps}`. Send `X-CNO-Session-Id` to chain runs. `spec_gaps` lists open questions to resolve once the canonical §6 spec is on hand. |
| §7 — Quick-reference behaviors | implemented as module-tag log + persisted audit log on each pipeline run |

## Endpoints

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/cno/process` | Full pipeline (batch) — request crosses all 5 nodes; returns `run_id` + classification/routing/anchor/persona/synthesis |
| POST | `/cno/process/stream` | Same pipeline as Server-Sent Events; emits `start`, 5× `node` (with `elapsed_ms`), `complete` |
| POST | `/cno/node/{node_name}` | Run one node in isolation (`input` / `router` / `memory` / `persona` / `synth`) |
| GET | `/cno/state` | Inspect recent memory anchors (live context stack) |
| POST | `/cno/state/reset` | Clear the memory stack |
| GET | `/cno/audit` | List recent runs (header summary, most recent first) |
| GET | `/cno/audit/stats` | Aggregated metrics for dashboard widgets — sparklines, donut, heat-map |
| GET | `/cno/audit/{run_id}` | Drill-down: full per-node trace for a single run |
| GET | `/healthz` | Liveness — also reports `auth_enabled` + `rate_limit_per_minute` |
| GET | `/` | Service banner + endpoint list |
| GET | `/docs` | Swagger UI (FastAPI default) |
| GET | `/ui/` | Browser dashboard (Console + Audit tabs) — only if `cno/static/` is built |

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn cno.app:app --reload
pytest -v
# open http://localhost:8000/docs

# 2. (Optional) Dashboard at /ui — requires Node 18+
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build       # bundles into ../cno/static/
# now http://localhost:8000/ui/ serves the Console + Audit dashboard

# Frontend dev with hot reload (proxies /cno/* to :8000):
npm run dev         # http://localhost:5173
```

## Dashboard

Two tabs:

- **Console** (default) — type a prompt and watch 5 trace cards fill in left-to-right via SSE. Active node pulses; completed nodes show elapsed ms + per-node output.
- **Audit Dashboard** — list of recent runs with sublayer / persona / clarity columns. Click a row to drill down into the full per-node payload-in / payload-out trace, backed by the SQLite audit log.

## Persistence + observability

- **SQLite audit log** at `cno_audit.db` (configurable via `CNO_DB_PATH`). Tables: `runs` (one row per pipeline call, includes `total_ms`) + `audit_log` (5 rows per call, one per node crossing). Append-only. Idempotent migrations on startup.
- **Structured JSON logs** to stderr, one object per line. Includes `run_id`, `session_id`, `sublayer`, `modality` on every pipeline run.
- **Memory Node** keeps an in-process FIFO (max 50 entries) *and* ships every anchor to the configured `ArchivalSink`. Sink failures never break the pipeline.

## AMC bridge (Canon #7)

`MemoryNode` accepts an optional `ArchivalSink`. Three implementations live in `cno/sinks.py`:

| Sink | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `NullSink` | Default — drops anchors silently |
| `JsonlSink` | Threadsafe append to a JSONL file (durable offline copy) |
| `HttpAMCSink` | POSTs anchors to `{url}/anchors` (real Canon #7 bridge — *contract pending publication*) |

Configure via env at process start:

```bash
CNO_AMC_SINK=jsonl                          # null | jsonl | http
CNO_AMC_JSONL_PATH=./cno_anchors.jsonl      # used when sink=jsonl
CNO_AMC_URL=https://amc.internal            # used when sink=http
CNO_AMC_API_KEY=...                         # optional bearer for http sink
```

## Auth + rate limiting

Disabled by default (single-user dev mode). Enable via env:

```bash
CNO_API_KEY=your-secret           # X-API-Key header required on all routes except bypass list
CNO_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://...   # CSV of CORS allow-list; defaults to "*"
CNO_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE=120     # set to 0 to disable; sliding 60-second window per key/IP
```

Bypass list (always reachable, no auth/rate-limit): `/healthz`, `/`, `/docs`, `/redoc`, `/openapi.json`, `/ui*`.

## LLM hook (deferred upgrade path)

Each node ships with substantially smarter heuristics — multi-signal modality detection, lexicon-driven tone scoring, multi-factor persona scoring matrix, real per-style synthesis transforms (hedge stripping, bulletization, cadence breaks). All include confidence scores.

When you want to swap heuristics for a real LLM, implement `cno.llm.LLMClassifier`:

```python
class LLMClassifier(Protocol):
    def classify(self, text: str, schema: str) -> dict[str, Any]: ...
```

Pass an instance into `InputNode(llm=...)` (other nodes can be wired the same way). Heuristics remain as fallback if the LLM raises. A worked Anthropic SDK example lives in `cno/llm.py`.

## Deployment

Two paths — pick whichever matches your target.

### A. Docker (recommended for any cloud)

```bash
cp .env.example .env        # then edit .env to set CNO_API_KEY, CORS, etc.
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose logs -f cno  # tail output
# open http://localhost:8000/ui/
```

What this gives you:

- Multi-stage build: stage 1 builds the React bundle, stage 2 ships the Python runtime — final image carries only what's needed.
- Persistent volume `cno-data` at `/data/` for the SQLite audit DB (`cno_audit.db`) and the optional JSONL anchor log (`cno_anchors.jsonl`).
- Non-root container user (`cno:cno`) for least privilege.
- Built-in HEALTHCHECK against `/healthz`.
- Honors every `CNO_*` env var from `.env`.

The image is platform-portable. Push the same image to **Fly.io / Railway / Render / AWS Fargate / GCP Cloud Run / a VPS** without code changes — only `.env` and the platform's volume binding change.

### B. Bare metal / VM (no Docker)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env        # edit
./scripts/run_prod.sh       # auto-builds the frontend if missing, runs uvicorn
```

The runner script reads `.env`, builds the frontend bundle if it isn't present, and starts uvicorn with `--proxy-headers` so it works behind a reverse proxy (nginx/Caddy/Traefik).

### Configuration reference

All knobs live in `.env`. See `.env.example` for the full list with comments. Production checklist:

| Setting | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| `CNO_API_KEY=...` | Without it, every endpoint is open to the internet |
| `CNO_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=...` | Tighten CORS to your real frontend hosts |
| `CNO_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE=` | Default 120/min; raise/lower based on expected load |
| `CNO_AMC_SINK=jsonl` or `http` | Turn on archival; `null` (default) discards anchors |
| `UVICORN_WORKERS=1` | **Keep at 1** until the in-process Memory Node FIFO is moved to shared storage. Multi-worker is safe for the audit log (SQLite handles it) but the live context stack is per-process. |

### TLS / reverse proxy

Don't terminate TLS in uvicorn. Put nginx, Caddy, or your platform's load balancer in front. Sample Caddy config:

```caddy
cno.example.com {
    reverse_proxy localhost:8000
}
```

## Integration map (canon cross-references)

| Canon # | Project | How CNO connects |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **#17 Seed Crystal — Input Processing Layer** | Front door | Provides input feed to CNO Input Node |
| **#10 Neural Lattice (NLCA)** | Zone substrate | CNO tags will conform to NLCA zones (planned) |
| **#16 Glyphic Codex DSL** | Vocabulary | Node tags use glyph encoding (📥 Input, 🔄 Router, 🧊 Memory, 🥥 Persona, 📤 OutputSynth) |
| **#7 AI_Memory_Core** | Long-term persistence | Bridge implemented: `HttpAMCSink` + `JsonlSink` + `NullSink`. The HTTP sink contract is a stub — confirm path/auth/schema against AMC once that service publishes its API. |
| **CSTM_Lattice v1.0** (parent spec) | Discipline contract | See *CSTM alignment* section above for current vs. planned coverage |

## Output format rules (per Sentinel Forge System Core Directive)

- Every internal operation prefixed with module tags:
  - `[Router Node: Activated → Analytical Layer]`
  - `[Memory Node: Context Anchor = "..."]`
- Symbolic state markers (used in narrative output, not enforced in code):
  - 🟢 active concept
  - 🟡 deferred / optional logic
  - 🔴 archived / deprecated path
- Clarity Score target ≥ 95 — `OutputSynthNode` reports a heuristic score on every
  synthesis; the score is reported, not currently enforced as a hard floor.
- Grounded in real-world 2025–2028 AI science (no fictional/mystical framing
  unless explicitly requested).
